#### Prometheus Sizing Calculator for YugabyteDB Anywhere
- Quickly estimate the memory, disk, and CPU requirements for your YugabyteDB Anywhere node running Prometheus, YB Platform and Postgres service.

**NOTE**: This only estimates the prometheus instance size i.e how much resource needed for Prometheus service to operate. YBA combines 2 more service yb-platform and postgres which also needs resource. So always add 3GiB to 4GiB buffer on top of what you get from this calculator to run YBA smoothly.

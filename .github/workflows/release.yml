# This workflow automates two key tasks:
# 1. On push to the main branch: It automatically copies the main HTML calculator to docs/index.html and commits the change.
#    This keeps your GitHub Pages site up-to-date without any manual work.
# 2. On new tag push (e.g., v1.0.0): It creates a new GitHub Release and attaches a .zip and .tar.gz archive 
#    containing the calculator and the shell script for users to download.
